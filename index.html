                <span>A Court of Thorns and Roses</span>
                <p>When nineteen-year-old huntress Feyre kills a wolf in the woods,
                    a beast-like creature arrives to demand retribution for it.
                    Dragged to a treacherous magical land, Feyre discovers that her captor 
                    is not an animal, but one of the lethal, immortal faeries who once ruled their world.

                <p>As Feyre has undergone more trials than one human woman can carry in her heart. 
                    Though she's now been granted the powers and lifespan of the High Fae, she is haunted 
                    by her time Under the Mountain and the terrible deeds she performed to save the lives of Tamlin and his people.

                <p>Feyre has returned to the Spring Court, determined to gather information on Tamlin's maneuverings 
                    and the invading king threatening to bring Prythian to its knees. But she must play a deadly game of deceit-and one slip may spell doom 
                    not only for Feyre, but for her world as well.

                <p>Feyre, Rhys and their companions are still busy rebuilding the Night Court 
                    and the vastly changed world beyond. But Winter Solstice is finally near, 
                    and with it a hard-earned reprieve. Yet even the festive atmosphere can't 
                    keep the shadows of the past from looming.
